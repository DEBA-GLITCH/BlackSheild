Blackshield is a Threat Intelligence Orchestrator built using LangGraph and external security APIs(NVD).

It autonomously gathers vulnerability intelligence, normalizes findings, correlates evidence,
applies deterministic risk scoring, stores contextual memory in a vector database (Chroma), and produces structured security reports.
